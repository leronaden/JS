/* 
Codewars Kata: Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3. You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will haveâ€¦*/
