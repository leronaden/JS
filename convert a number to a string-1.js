/* We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

To convert an integer to a string, use the str() built-in function. The function takes an integer (or other type) as its input and produces a string as its output.*/



function numberToString(num) {
    return String(num)
    // Return a string of the number here!
  }
